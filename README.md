 # My very first web page

Welcome!

This page was created in cloud9 IDE where we generated three pages hyperlinked to eachother showing the technoligies being learned on each of the streams 
of the Code Institute Full Stack Developer course.

Index.html is labelled as stream-one however without an index.html page the site will not function hence the rename
each of the technoliges used are linked to their own wikipedia entries to provide anyone who's interested with additinla information

## Worth Noting 

the reamde.md file is in markup language whch provides little shortcuts to html code, such as the hashtags providing heading titles 

The stylsheet generated provides the style info used through the three pages. It took me ages to find out that these are case sensitve: 
if the folder is names in uppercase and the link in lowercase, there is no connetion made.

The icons are in an undordered list (ul)
each list item (li) has padding and margin removed 
I floated the icons left with a 10% margin and a width of 20% to deivide thr images and to provide some consistnecy to the pages

We used the hex names for graphite gray for the backgrough and the lettering is white. We then reversed this for mouse over 

So far this project has taught a good deal of the fundamentals of coding from scratch and the evidence is here to see!

###Well done Code Insitute!
